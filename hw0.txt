# Description of your program (part 7)
 This is a program enable to count the number of words in a document.
1 Import a file address.
2 The program is going to read the whole words in this file.
3 Every time it read a blank space or punctuation after a letter,
  the program will accumulate number which starts from zero.
4 Once it finish the reading process, it will return the final cumulative number to the user.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
It seems confusing at first, but I quickly find the meaning of this process.
Every time before I design a program, I need to figure out the purpose and process of this program.
It just like we need to have a draft or outline for our paper.
Only when our logical method is clear can we approach our goal with the minimum number of codes.
Hopefully, I'll be able to learn how to do more in python.
Using this programming thinking to make it easier for me in my future works.
